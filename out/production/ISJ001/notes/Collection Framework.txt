# Collection Framework


Framework :
	- Predefined set of code
	- Java based framework will contain predefined set of classes, interface, methods
	- solutions provided for set of problems faced.
	- Collection framework comes with standard JDK
	- Spring, Hibernate Selenium frameworks need to addd externally in the project


# Drawbacks of Array :
	1. Array is fixed in size
	2. Either shortage or wastage of memory
	3. We can only store homogeous data
	4. No method supprt. For every requirement such as insert, delete, search sort in a given array developer is suppoed to write code.

# Collection Framework:
	- It is also predefined set of code which contains classes, interfaces, methods
	- All the collection framework classes, interfaces are part of java.util package
	- Solution:
			1. It overcomes the drawbacks of Array.
			2. With the help of collection framework we can store multiple values[objects] which can 						be of same type or different type as a single unit.
			3. With the collection we can store homogeneous as well as hetergoneous data.
			4. Method support is available.
			5. Collections are growable in nature.


# Collection Hierarchy

# Iterable(I)
- interface present in java.lang package
- it contains -  public abstract java.util.Iterator<T> iterator();


# Collection(I):
- It is an inteface present inside java.util package which extends java.lang.Iterable
- It has three direct sub-interfaces : List, Set, Queue
- It contains several these below methods:

1. to Add single element :  public abstract boolean add(E);
2. To Add multiple elements: public abstract boolean addAll(java.util.Collection<? extends E>);
3. To remove single element: public abstract boolean remove(java.lang.Object);
4  To remove multiple elements:  public abstract boolean removeAll(java.util.Collection<?>);
5. To remove elements based on condition: public boolean removeIf(java.util.function.Predicate<? super E>);
6. To remove all the elements from a given container:   public abstract void clear();
7. To find the no. elements :  public abstract int size();
8. to check if collection is empty or not: public abstract boolean isEmpty();
9. To check if a given element is there or not :  public abstract boolean contains(java.lang.Object);
10. To check if multiple given elements are there or not :   public abstract boolean containsAll(java.util.Collection<?>);
11. public abstract boolean equals(java.lang.Object);
12. public abstract int hashCode();
13. to get the array from given collection : public abstract <T> T[] toArray(T[]);
14. public abstract java.util.Iterator<E> iterator();
15. To remove the elements except specifed elemenets: public abstract boolean retainAll(java.util.Collection<?>);
16. public java.util.Spliterator<E> spliterator();
17. public java.util.stream.Stream<E> stream();
18. public java.util.stream.Stream<E> parallelStream();


# List (I)
- it is an interface which is present in java.util package
- List extends Collection(I)
- List has 4 implementations : ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector, Stack
- Some extra methods which are there in List :

	When to List implementing classes?
		- List will help us store multiple elements which can be duplicate
		- It will help us maintain insertion order


# ArrayList:
1. It is an implementation List present in java.util package
2. It helps in storing the duplicate elements
3. It maintains the insertion order of elements
4. It can store homogeneous as well as heterogeneous elements
5. Null insertion is possible any number of times.
6. ArrayList is best for retrival of data
7. ArrayList is worst for modification of data.
9. ArrayList internally maintains the growable array data structure.
		Object[] value = new Object[10];
	- ArrayList will maintain initial array of size 10. Once this array is full it will create new array with new capacity
		New Capacity = Old Capacity + Old Capacity * 0.5 + 1;
10. ArrayList methods are not synchronized. ArrayList is not a thread safe class.


# Vector:
1. It is an implementation of List present in java.util package
2. It helps in storing the duplicate elements
3. It maintains the insertion order of elements
4. It can store homogeneous as well as heterogeneous elements
5. Null insertion is possible any number of times.
6. Vector is best for retrival of data
7. Vector is worst for modification of data.
9. Vector internally maintains the growable array data structure.
		Object[] value = new Object[10];
	- Vecotr will maintain initial array of size 10. Once this array is full it will create new array with new capacity
		New Capacity = 2 * Old Capacity;
10. Vector methods are synchronized. Vector is a thread safe class.
11. It is a legacy class.
