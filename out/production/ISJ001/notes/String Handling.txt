# String Handling

To store multiple characters : char[] array = {'a','b'};
- Complex to store the data
- Method supprt is not there. Search, Sort, Replace, Delete, insert

- String
- StringBuilder
- StringBuffer


# String :
- it is immutable class present inside the java.lang pacakge
- Immutable class means its object cannot modified once the object is created.
- String class implements Serializable, Comparable, CharSequence
- String class internally maintains an array of character to store the data.
- It also overrides equals(), hashCode(), toString() methods. [methods from Object class]
	- equals() : compares the string object based on the content 
	- toString(): prints the content of the string object

* We can create String class objects using two ways:
	1. using new keyword
			e.g. String str = new String("abc");
		
		- In this compulsoray objec will be created inside the heap memory area.
		- Also String object will be created inside the SCP memory area if the object content is not present already.
	
		In this reference will always point to heap memory area object

	2. using literal way
			e.g String str = "abc";
	
	- This way is only applicable for String class only.
	- In this way String object is not created inside the HEAP but it will created inside the SCP if the object content is not present already.


# SCP 
	- it stands for String Constant Pool memory area
	- this is used to store only String class objects
	- SCP is under HEAP memory from Java 7 onwards
	- Before Java 7 SCP was under Class memory area.
	- will unique objects


# What is an Immutable class and how to create?
- Immutable class means its object content cannot be modified
- To Create the Immutable class:
		1. make the class final
		2. make the data members final and private
		3. Do not provide public setters

# Why String class is an Immutable class?
- To avoid the String content modification as there are multiple references pointing to the same object.


String : Immutable


Mutable class:

StringBuilder
StringBuffer

- java.lang package
- mutable means its object content can be modified.
- To modify the object content , there are plenty methods provided.
	- append
	- insert
	- delete
	- reverse



- StringBuffer is Thread safe [Slower as compared to StringBuilder]
- StringBuilder is not a thread safe.



StringBuilder:
	- only way to create StringBuilder is using new keyword.
	- StringBuilder and StringBuffer objects will be stored only inside the HEAP and NOT in SCP.
